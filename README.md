<strong>Thoughts on the project:</strong>

This was a tough project, but was well designed to get us used to working with WordPress. It was hard to get used to using WordPress
at the beginning, but as I worked more on the project the more comfortable I became. 

While this project was difficult and took a long time to complete, I really enjoyed putting the site together and see how WordPress
is very client friendly. I look forward to using WordPress in the future!
